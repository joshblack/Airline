#Airline Web Application

 > Project for CIS4301, Database Systems and Information, at the University of Florida. In this project, we were are asked to design an online system for a airline booking system

##Project Specification
Your database should allow arbitrary number of trips/ legs/ reservations/ payments. Your interface should allow at least two different roles to modify the following:

1. **Flight Search** - Customers may check available flights (basic search): by date, time and airport of departure and return flights. Customers may also check available flights given around a specific date, say +/- 2 days for a given date, departure and arrival locations..
2. **Payment** - Customers may make a payment with the exact amount of the trip. Note: No overselling (or overbooking) is allowed.
4. **Adjustments** - Airline agents may add/delete/adjust future flight schedule and other information. 


You may add additional functions as long as it is consistent with the system.  
One bonus part: your interface may have a login page where a user can put username and password to log in such that. 

1. **Customers** - may login to the system to retrieve all the trips they had booked/paid.
2. **Agents** - may login to see the sales, such as the empty seat.
